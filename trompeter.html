        <h3>Hey Doug,</h3>
        
        <p>Great to hear from you!</p>
        
        <p>I have been with WMS (now SG) since 2004, and cannot say enough how much I love my job composing and creating sound design for games.</p>
        
        <p>Over the past few years, a new, very forward looking management team has taken over, and it has never been a better time to be here. The new initiatives and programs, as well as synergies of different platforms combining to strengthen our branding and product portfolio offers fantastic opportunities for market share growth.</p>
        
        <p>Without question SG is an amazing place, and now is never a better time to come aboard.</p>
        
        <p>Since Covid, we have been based in our home's, coming down when needed for games reviews and sound balancing. But, our office is connected to the Merchandise Mart, on Orleans St. (we moved there in 2018 after being on the northside for over 20 years).</p>
        
        <p>Good luck, hope to see you with us.</p>
        
        <p>Jim</p>
